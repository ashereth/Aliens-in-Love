# Aliens in Love
This is a short platformer style game level that I created for the class CMPM120 at UCSC.  

The goal is to reach your girlfriend on the other side of the map who got lost when you crash landed on earth.  
Make sure to collect any coins you find on the way. Even aliens know that saving money is important in this economy.
